This is a basic React app demonstrating how to use React Context API for handling simple authentication. The app includes:

A Login Page

A Private Page (accessible only when logged in)

A Context Provider for managing auth state globally

This is ideal for learning how to use context for managing authentication in a small React project without external libraries like Redux or Firebase.
